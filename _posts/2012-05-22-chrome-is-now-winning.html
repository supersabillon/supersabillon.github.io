<p><a href="http://memeburn.com/2012/05/its-official-chrome-is-the-webs-most-popular-browser/">Google Chrome overtakes Internet Explorer</a> as the Web’s most used browser.</p>
<p>I remember when Chrome first came out, I gave it a try but it was full of bugs so I quickly went back to Opera. I gave it another try few years ago and it has been my favorite ever since.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m surprised Opera is so low in this <a href="http://s4.cdn.memeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/StatCounter-browser-ww-weekly-201120-201220.jpg">graph</a> though, it really is a great browser but according to the stats it is less popular than Safari? </p>
<p>As a developer it makes my heart happy to see people switching from IE to Chrome/Firefox. Hope this trend continues. </p>
