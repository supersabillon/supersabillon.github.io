I really wished I had played more but from the few I played **my favorite 5 games of 2016** are:

* [Star Knight ($0.99)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1077346638) - really fun and challenging hack-and-slash platformer, with a dope art style that reminds me of Limbo. 

* [Pocket Mortys (free)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rick-and-morty-pocket-mortys/id992640880?mt=8) - one of my favorites of the year, created by Adult Swim, it's a Pokemon like game but with Rick and Morty, were you collect Mortys instead of pokemon.

* [the battle of Polytopia (free)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-battle-of-polytopia/id1006393168?mt=8) - formerly known as Super Tribes, its my favorite turn base strategy game for mobile so far. The developer recently added multiplayer support as well.

* [Bullet Force (free)](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/bullet-force/id1009134067?mt=8) - Multiplayer First-Person Shooter that actually works very well with touchscreen control. Love the game, came out in late November and still addicted to it.

* [Super Mario Run ($9.99)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-mario-run/id1145275343) - An actual official mobile game from Nintendo, a must-buy from me and I actually really recommend it. So far I'm in World 4, collecting all the color coins is very challenging and there's 5 characters to unlock. 

Pretty decent games came out in 2016, let's hope 2017 brings us more quality mobile games!
