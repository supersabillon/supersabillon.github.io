<p>Not going to lie, when I read <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/google-begins-testing-its-augmented-reality-glasses/">this headline from the NY Times</a> the first thing that came to my mind was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq5KWLqUewc">Deus Ex</a>.</p>
<p>So Google&#8217;s secret team(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/technology/at-google-x-a-top-secret-lab-dreaming-up-the-future.html?_r=1">Google X</a>) is working on Project Glass which are glasses that are also computers. Not sure how to feel about this. I want one, but I also hate people that talk to themselves using Bluetooth headsets. Plus the current <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/04/technology/bits-glasses2/bits-glasses2-blog480.jpg">prototypes</a> look ridiculous.</p>
<p>Who knows though, maybe 20 years from now kids will be laughing at us for using phones and cameras.Â <br/><br/>Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">Google&#8217;s video</a> showing the potential of Project Glass.</p>
