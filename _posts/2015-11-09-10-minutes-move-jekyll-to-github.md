This is probably one of the easiest things I have ever done.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service from GitHub that I have been interesting in using since it plays nice with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's free hosting and push your commits and changes automatically go live. Not need to ftp! So this weekend I finally decided to move my site from ASmallOrange to Github.io.

All I did was:

* Create repo, clone it - just how GitHub explains [here](https://pages.github.com/#create-repo-step).
* Copy files of my site and paste them into my new repo
* Run Jekyll to build my site
* add, commit and push

That's it. In a few minutes my GitHub.io page supersabillon.github.io was already showing my site.

Never have I done so little effort to move an entire site to a new host provider.

I already updated my domain's DNS settings in GoDaddy to point here. I followed this very helpful [guide](http://andrewsturges.com/blog/jekyll/tutorial/2014/11/06/github-and-godaddy.html).
