I know I'm late on this and by now probe [Philae](https://twitter.com/Philae2014) has even ran out of batteries, but I'm still fascinated by this.

A mission that was approved in 1993, launched in 2004 and 10 years later Philae landed on a comet flying at 80,000 miles per hour around 300 millions miles from Earth. That just blows my mind. My favorite part is the probe's itinerary:
