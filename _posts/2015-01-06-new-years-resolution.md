I don't normally do New Year's Resolution. I can't even remember if I tried to do one last year, but these year I got a few which are personal but a geeky resolution I have is: To go back to playing super cheap games on Steam. I actually have a decent backlog of games I haven't started. Last year I spent most of my free time either watching shitty tv or playing WiiU, which is great but I can't afford buying $60 games anymore. 

Only a few days into 2015 and I already finished Machinarium and started playing Torchlight. Really enjoying my free time now and can't wait to get into more games. I mean check out these titles I have in my backlog:

* Frozen Synapse
* Tomb Raider
* Amnesia: The Dark Descent
* Borderlands
* Magicka
* Sonic Generations
* Terraria

I can't even remember when I bought these games (gotta love Steam sales). Also the great thing about playing these old games is that I don't have to worry about having a 3-4 year old computer!
