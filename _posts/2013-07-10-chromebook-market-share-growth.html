<p>Latest <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-10/google-chromebook-under-300-defies-pc-market-with-growth.html">report from Bloomberg</a> show Google Chromebook has snagged a 25% market share of laptops under $300 in the past 8 months. </p>
<p>Overall 25% is still very low considering the few options consumers have for laptops under $300. When Google announced the Chromebook I didn&#8217;t think too much of it, but I was still surprised when people said Chromebook would not last too long. I thought it was a cool product, not for me or any power user but I can see why some people would enjoy it.</p>

<p>I remember 2 or 3 years ago I bought my sister a 10&#8221; Dell netbook for around 200sh dollars. I tried it out before giving it away and noticed how sluggish it performed. It runs Windows 7 and has a hard drive. Now with the same amount of cash you could get a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpBigjzuU4Y">snappy Google Chromebook</a>, with a Flash drive and nicer screen. </p>
<p>I think this is perfect for High school and College students (depending on their majors), or even regular folks who don&#8217;t game, edit videos or do any programming. </p>
