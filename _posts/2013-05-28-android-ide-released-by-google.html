<p>So Google finally released an IDE for Android development. It is kinda old news but forgot to post about it. It will be called <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a>. This is great news for developers but also for consumers as better apps will be put out in the market.<br/><br/>For more in depth look at Android Studio watch this vid:<br/><br/></p>
