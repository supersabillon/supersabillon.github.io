<p><a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop">The first draft of Hyperloop</a> is what everybody been talking since yesterday. Great article really, especially for us living in LA or SF. It was put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>, creator of Tesla Motors, Space X and PayPal.</p>
<p>He explains how it would work, how much it would cost and compares it to the current CA High Speed Rail plans. </p>
<p>What stuck for me was:</p>
<ul><li>CA HSR one way ticket would cost $105 and travel time of 2 hours and 38 minutes.</li>
<li>Hyperloop would be cheaper (estimated $20 one way ticket plus some costs) and travel time would be 35 minutes.</li>
<li>Estimated cost for Hyperloop is $6 billion while CA HSR is $68.4 billion. </li>
<li>Capsules with 28 passengers each would be departing every few minutes</li>
<li>Tubes would be on &#8220;pylons&#8221; running above the 5 freeway, no need to buy land like with HSR.</li>
</ul><p>Very cool and serious first draft. </p>
