<p>I never really had a proper blog until now. Don&#8217;t get too excited though, this won&#8217;t be a personal blog. I will write a lot about web development, technology, programming and video games. To spice things up I might write about my two favorite hobbies: reading and collecting/building LEGO sets. Actually my favorite things to do is supporting the Los Angeles Galaxy and eating but I promise not to write about soccer or food. <br/><br/>I guess I can start by sharing some things about me: </p>
<p>Currently I code and game in a custom-built PC running Windows 7. Tools I use: Notepad++(editor), Dropbox(storage), A Small Orange(hosting), Google Analytics (Analytics), Subversion (Version control), Google Docs (Word processor and Spreadsheets), Gmail (email), Chrome (browsing), Firefox with Firebug (troubleshooting), Photoshop (design), and I think that&#8217;s about it. I&#8217;ve been interested in getting a MacBook Pro but I&#8217;m waiting on Apple to update their current model. Most likely some of my dev tools will change once I work in a Mac environment.</p>
<p>The specs of my battle station are:</p>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-2500&#160;3.3GHz Quad-Core</li>
<li>Mobo: MSI PH67S-C43 (B3) ATX LGA1155</li>
<li>Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1333</li>
<li>Video Card: XFX Radeon HD 6870&#160;1GB</li>
<li>Storage: Samsung Spinpoint F3&#160;1TB 3.5&#8221; 7200RPM Hard drive </li>
<li>Power Supply: Corsair 650W ATX12V / EPS12V</li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;m pretty happy about the performance, but I would like to upgrade to an SSD pretty soon.</p>
<p>In regards to gaming, currently I&#8217;ve been playing Bastion. Really enjoying it so far, the narrator and the story is something unique. Also it has a pretty good soundtrack. Right now you could also find me reading Alan Moore&#8217;s <em>From Hell</em>, which is a story about Jack The Ripper. Excellent book so far even though I have to keep looking up words online because it uses numerous British slang words. If I&#8217;m not eating, playing, working or reading then you will find me eyeing this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Death-10188/dp/B002EEP3NO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332357989&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self">LEGO Star Wars Death Star</a> set that I would love to have in my hands.</p>
<p>Hope you guys enjoy my future blog posts.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
