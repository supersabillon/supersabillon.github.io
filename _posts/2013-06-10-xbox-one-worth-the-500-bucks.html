<p>Microsoft announced today at <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/">e3</a><span> that <span>Xbox</span> One will have a $500 price tag in the US.</span></p>

<p><br/><span>My first reaction was &#8220;<span>woah</span> that&#8217;s a bit pricey&#8221;. So let&#8217;s go into more detail to see if this console is indeed worth the 500 bucks. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul><li><span><span>Blu</span>-ray drive</span></li>
<li>Skype video calling</li>
<li><span>Updated <span>Kinect</span> 1080p camera</span></li>
<li>Twitch (new feature to broadcast gaming sessions)</li>
<li>Multi-tasking (be able to pause game and go back to dashboard)</li>
<li>500GB storage (360 Elite comes with 250GB at $399)</li>
<li><span>Games will be in the cloud (which means once you install you can play your game at any <span>Xbox</span> One)</span></li>
<li><span>Steaming services, confirmed right now: <span>Netflix</span>, <span>Hulu</span> Plus, Amazon Instant Video, <span>Youtube</span>, ESPN, <span>Vimeo</span>, HBO Go, NHL, MLB.<span>tv</span> and others</span></li>
<li>Internet Explorer</li>
<li><span><span>Facebook</span></span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul><li>No backward compatibility (360 games will be useless)</li>
<li>No used-games will be allowed to be played</li>
<li>$100 more expensive than PS4</li>
</ul><p><strong>Hardware<br/></strong><span>The <span>Xbox</span> One has an APU with eight x86-64 cores, 8&#160;GB of DDR3 RAM with a memory bandwidth of 68.3&#160;GB/s, a 500&#160;GB non-replaceable hard drive. 3&#160;GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system and apps, leaving 5&#160;GB for games. The graphics processing unit (GPU) is based on an AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, which have a total of 768 cores, providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.23 TFLOPS.

<p><strong>So&#8230;<br/></strong><span>About the cons, I don&#8217;t really care about the no backward compatibility. It sucks yes, but I don&#8217;t play old games as much and as long as you keep your 360 you&#8217;re good. But the No Used-Games policy really bugs me. I love buying used games on <span>craigslist</span>/<span>ebay</span> so this is a big deal for me.</span></p>
<p>The pros are great really, but the one I only care about is the multi-tasking one. The rest just make this game console into an all-in-one media center.  If you already own a smart-TV, a blu-ray player, an AppleTV or Roku then you don&#8217;t really need all these extra features.<br/><br/><span>One positive I see is that purchasing an <span>Xbox</span> One allows you to move all these other devices to another TV you might have in another room.</span></p>
<p>So is it worth the $500? I think yes. Most people will say well the PS4 is cheaper, yes but that doesn&#8217;t mean its a better console. I&#8217;m a PC Gamer and a happy owner of a 360 so will I buy one? Not sure, I don&#8217;t need it right now. But after seeing some of the games previewed today at E3 like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XntWmxvgcg">Killer Instinct</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RfO1IiqNqw"><span><span>Forza</span> 5</span></a> is gonna be tough not to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>What I wish<br/></strong><span>An <span>Xbox</span> One Light version would be ideal for me. I just want to play games, offer me a console without media center capabilities and for cheaper and I would <span>pre</span>-order right now.</span></p>
