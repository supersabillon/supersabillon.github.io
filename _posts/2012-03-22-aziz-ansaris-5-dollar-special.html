<p>If you are not an <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/azizansari">Aziz Ansari</a> fan then skipped to third paragraph. What, you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFEwFw4PqPg">him</a>?<br/><br/>If you&#8217;re a fan then may I suggest you purchase his new $5 stand up special <a href="http://azizansari.com/">Dangerous Delicious</a>? </p>
<p>This is kind of a big deal because is a business model that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers'_market">farmers</a> have be doing for a while which is skipping the middleman. This results in better prices for the consumer and better products.<br/><br/>People (including me) sometimes pirate stuff because: a. We don&#8217;t like ads, b. We don&#8217;t like censorship, c. We hate DRM and d. Price is too expensive. Aziz is following the model of what Louis CK did with his <a href="https://buy.louisck.net/">Live at the Beacon</a> special. He skipped the middleman, sold (and still selling) his special with no ads, DRM-free, no censorship and just for 5 bucks. Some of you pay more for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>If we as consumers support this type of business model more artists will follow suit. For example Joe Rogan and Jim Gaffigan have mentioned of releasing a special for 5 bucks as well.<br/><br/>Maybe not everybody will be able to be successful with this type of model. So always remember to go to comedy clubs and shows. That&#8217;s the best way to show your support.</p>
