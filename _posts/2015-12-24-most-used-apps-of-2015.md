I wish I had the actual usage data of my apps throughout the year. But here are the ones I think I used the most. I like to always check my battery usage and see which apps I'm actually using and delete apps I don't use. So I have a pretty good idea of which are my most used apps.

* [Kindle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle-read-books-ebooks-magazines/id302584613?mt=8) - I stopped buying physical books in 2015 and this app has changed my life
* [Snapchat](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8) - this is what everybody is using and I have to stay up to date with Dj Khaled
* [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12) - Twitter is still a thing and this app is way better than the official twitter app
* [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8) - why not
* [Beme](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beme-share-video.-honestly./id1005178547?mt=8) - new app to share videos using the proximity sensor, love it
* [Yahoo Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149?mt=8) - The best weather app!
* [Strava](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strava-running-cycling-gps/id426826309?mt=8) - This app is great to track your bicycle rides, I use it every time I ride
