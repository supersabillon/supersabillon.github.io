<p>Google released today the <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2013/07/from-tvs-to-tablets-everything-you-love.html">Chromecast</a>, which apparently is already <a href="https://twitter.com/mashable/status/360114227408683008">sold out</a> in the play store.</p>
<p>It pretty much is what Apple does with Airplay and AppleTV but this device works cross platform, on Chrome for Mac and PC, iPhones, iPads, and Android devices. For only 35 bucks this might become a must have for everyone with a phone/tablet and HDTV.Â </p>
<p>At the moment it only works with Netflix, Youtube, Google Play Music/TV and you can also mirror an Chrome Tab as well. More apps (like Pandora) will be supported soon according to Google.</p>
