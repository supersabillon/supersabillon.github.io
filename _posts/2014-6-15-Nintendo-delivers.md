Now that [E3](http://www.e3expo.com/) is done, I just want to recap real quick what a great job Nintendo did. 

2 new IPs
---------
Nintendo announced two new IPs. The first one below is *Captain Toad* which is pretty much a full puzzle game based on the Toad puzzle minigames of *Super Mario 3D World*, which were super fun to play. Game will be released later this year.

The second IP that I'm really exciting about is called *Splatoon*, a third-person shooter game but instead of guns the characters carry ink guns. The player's goal is to have the most territory inked in their team's color before the match ends. It is schedule to release until 2015, and should be playable by up to 8 players in 4 vs 4 matches.

2 new Zelda titles
------------------
*Hyrule Warriors*, a collaboration of Zelda and Dynasty Warriors games, is a title we already knew about but we did get a release date: August 14.

What got everyone excited including me is that we got a look at the new *Legend of Zelda for WiiU* game. Release date is not until 2015 but the wait should be worth it. Check out this beautiful trailer:

And more goodies
-----------------
We [found out](http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/10/5795960/star-fox-wii-u-nintendo-miyamoto) that a new *Star Fox* game for Wii U is in early development. My guess is that we will see some gameplay and a release date at the next E3, but still exciting to know that it's eventually coming.

We also got a look at the new *Super Smash Bross for Wii U*, still no release date though. Rumors indicate that will probably release around xmas time.

Other cool games coming out are *Yarn Yoshi*, *Clay Kirby*, *Mario Party* and a new game/concept which I think is something everyone wanted for a while: *Mario Maker*.

Nintendo fans should be satisfied and people on the fence about buying a Wii U should be conviced that this console is determined to produce some quality games, and I haven't even mentioned *Mario Kart 8* which is a single enough reason to get a Wii U!
