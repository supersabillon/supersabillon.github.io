<p>The <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-207">10,000th near-Earth object</a> was detected a few days ago. Pretty cool milestone to reach.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I began surveying for asteroids and comets in 1992, a near-Earth object discovery was a rare event," said Tim Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center. "These days we average three NEO discoveries a day, and each month the Minor Planet Center receives hundreds of thousands of observations on asteroids, including those in the main-belt. The work done by the NASA surveys, and the other international professional and amateur astronomers, to discover and track NEOs is really remarkable." </p>

<p>Scary and awesome at the same time. Not to be worried though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>This reduces the risk to human populations, because once an NEO threat is known well in advance, the object could be deflected with current space technologies. </span></p>
