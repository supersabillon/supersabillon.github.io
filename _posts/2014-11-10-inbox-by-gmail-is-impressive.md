The gmail team at Google launched this new app called [Inbox](http://www.google.com/inbox/) which I've been trying out for a few days now. It's a web app and also a mobile app (Android and iPhone, not sure about Windows).

It really is just another app to check your email but it is AWESOME. I actually already turned off my Gmail notifications because I don't plan on using it anymore. I also no longer use Keep for reminders because Inbox handles reminders and emails in a very intuitive way.

It's nothing revolutionary, Inbox is similar to Gmail but a little more task oriented. When you get an email it gets bundled up in a category, you open it and have a few options: *Snooze* it to reply or read later or mark it as *Done* or pin a *Reminder* to it. You can also just close it and it will stay in your inbox as a 'read' email if you're into that... 

You can already do all these tasks with the current Gmail but Inbox really makes it easier and simple. Marking an item as *Done* is the same as *Archiving* on Gmail. It is not deleted but it is removed from your inbox.  Before, I probably had thousands of emails in my inbox that were already read but I didn't bother *Archiving* them. But now thanks to Inbox, I got my inbox empty. If you're already very organized with your Gmail maybe Inbox will not be that big of a deal but for people like me who got lazy about it then it's perfect.

Currently Inbox by Gmail is invitation only. Post your emails in the comments and if I get more invitations I'll send you one.
