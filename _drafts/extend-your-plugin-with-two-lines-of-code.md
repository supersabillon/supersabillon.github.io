While developing a jQuery plugin I thought about cool it would be if it had a callback capability, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to write tons of lines of code for a feature that wasn't essential.

Then I did some research and realized it would only takes two lines of code to make this happen.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var defaults = {

}

{% endhighlight %}
