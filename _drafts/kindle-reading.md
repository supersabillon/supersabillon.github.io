So it's been a while since I've bought a physical book. But last year, sometime in June I got a used Kindle. I was checking out my amazon digital orders and I realized I read 31 books between June 2015 to June 2016. And that includes Game of Thrones which took me an [entire month to read!](https://twitter.com/supersabillon/status/748561637070671872)
