So it's been a while since I've bought a physical book. But last year, sometime in June I got a used Kindle. I was checking out my amazon digital orders and I realized I read 31 books between June 2015 to June 2016. And that includes Game of Thrones which took me an [entire month to read!](https://twitter.com/supersabillon/status/748561637070671872).

For you that amount might not be a big deal but for me it is, since I usually read around 10 books a year. Anyways, so this post is really about the Kinde, since now I love it so much, and I used to be part of the "I prefer physical books" camp.

A few months after I got it, my kindle actually broke, but with the Kindle also comes the Kindle app for your phone. So I kept reading using the app and the experience is not as great as a proper Kindle reader, but is still is pretty good.

### Reasons why Kindle rulez!

* First reason is the obvious: Digital media rocks when you start collecting lots of books. No need to worry about where to put them, or if you're reading a huge book then it weights nothing if it is digital.

* Depending on the circumstance, most of the time a book requires both hands, you can easily read a kindle one-handed. Very useful when riding the bus and need a hand to grab onto something.
