If you do lots of local development, for quick POCs, testing new features or for whatever reason I'm sure you've ran into multiple issues running your site locally using the File protocol (file://):

* Images with relative paths break
* AJAX requests from local files do not work
* External JavaScript libraries and APIs also do not work
