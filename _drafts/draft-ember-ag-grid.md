Happy to announce my first emberjs addon: [ember-ag-grid](https://github.com/supersabillon/ember-ag-grid).

[Ag-Grid](https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/) is an excellent javascript data grid library written by (Niall Crosby)[https://github.com/ceolter]. It is fast, supports filtering, column pinning, sorting and it is super simple to use. Also written in pure javascript, no dependencies!

I noticed that the author had addons for AngularJS, React and Angular 2 but no addon for Emberjs. So I decided to create a very simple addon that wraps the ag-grid library.
